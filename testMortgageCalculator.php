/*the basic formula for finding the monthly payment of a mortgage is as follows:
          r(1+r) ^n
 M = P ----------------   
        [(1+r) ^n] -1

where M = Monthly Payment; P = Principle; r = rate; n = number of payments.

Additionally "^n" means "raised to the power of n" kind of like 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
so we need to GET the Principle (LoanAmount) from a user, GET the number of months (entered as a year - LoanDuration) from the user, 
and also the Rate (InterestRate). I've factored in the need to change the duration given in a year number to months (30 yrs*12 months = 360 months) 
as well as needing to change the Interest Rate to a decimal (eg. 3.5% * 100 = 0.0035)
I hope I've commented this enough that you can easily write the code and correct any errors in my tests.
